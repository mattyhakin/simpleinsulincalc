Simple Insulin Calculator Project â€“ Matt Hakin

A Simple python-based calculator to work out Insulin dosage
 The calculator can work out dosage based on configured ratios. the calculator has the following meal types for calculation Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack & Correctional, which can be configured into the code itself.
 
The calculator could be useful doe newly diagnosed Diabetics who are getting used to the math that comes with working out dosage based upon an ever-changing saturation with ratios. 
In the future I am looking to add in a GUI element to the calculator to make it more user friendly.

This is my first Python Project and I am open to suggestiosn to improve it
